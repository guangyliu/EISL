## Usage (Fairseq)
Put the *EISL.py* file in to *fairseq/fairseq/criterions/EISL.py*, then you can train with EISL loss by adding *--criterion EISL* into fairseq command.

If you want to reproduce our results, please refer to [fairseq/README.md](./fairseq/README.md) for more implementation details (pretrained models, preprocessed datasets, running scripts, and generated files).
### Non-Autoregressive Machine Translation
For the NAT experiments, NAT codes (fairseq) and models are released in the NAT folder. We also provide the models trained by CE loss. The results are reported in the paper.

## Usage (HuggingFace, Need to be verified)
You can override the *compute_loss* function of Trainer like shown in *EISL_trainer.py*.
