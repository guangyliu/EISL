This is the script and code of NAT task in fairseq.

The models are in Google drive (include our models and the pretrained models trained by us):
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cxp1genAtfJFEbXgj8t6UgeG_DSffCvt?usp=sharing

After downloading the models, you can put the models and *eval.sh* into the [fairseq](../fairseq) folder and run it by 
```shell
bash eval.sh
```
